Source Code for Single Page Web Application built with Angular 8 Framework and Bulma CSS. 

## Why?
This application was built solely by me in order to practice my new skills developed after taking an Angular 8 Course. 
I have taken this course in order to stay up-to-date with modern technologies and frameworks and to get used to the modern
style of SPAs over MPAs. This is my first Angular-based web application so it is not great. I tried to focus mainly on authentication, component-based architecture, and routing as those are essential concepts when dealing with SPAs.

## In order to test
To test the app just sign up with an email and password. Then your in!
